This realization requires an additional U(1)<SUB>R</SUB> × Z<SUB>n</SUB> symmetry for its successful implementation. The standard model (SM) gauge singlet scalar components of 24<SUB>H</SUB> and 10<SUB>H</SUB> GUT Higgs superfields are respectively employed to realize successful inflation in SU(5) and flipped SU(5) models. The predictions of the various inflationary observables lie within the recent Planck bounds on the scalar spectral index, n<SUB>s</SUB>, for n &gt;= 5 in SU(5) model and for n &gt;= 6 in flipped SU(5) model. In particular, the tensor to scalar ratio r and the running of spectral index d n<SUB>s</SUB>/ d ln k are negligibly small and lie in the range, 10<SUP>-12</SUP> lesssim r lesssim 10<SUP>-8</SUP> and 10<SUP>-9</SUP> lesssim dn<SUB>s</SUB>/d ln k lesssim 10<SUP>-3</SUP>, for realistic values of n. In numerical estimation of the various predictions, we fix the gauge symmetry breaking scale, M, around 2 × 10<SUP>16</SUP> GeV . The issue of gauge coupling unification in R-symmetric SU(5) is evaded by adding vectorlike families with mass splitting within their multiplets. The dilution of monopoles beyond the observable limit is naturally achieved in the breaking of SU(5) gauge symmetry during inflation. A realistic scenario of reheating with non-thermal leptogenesis is employed for both models. The predicted range of reheat temperature within Planck bounds, 3 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> GeV lesssim T<SUB>r</SUB> lesssim 2 × 10<SUP>9</SUP> GeV, is safe from the gravitino problem for the gravitino mass, m<SUB>3/2</SUB> gtrsim 10 TeV .

We conclude that, in all acceptable spontaneous symmetry breaking schemes, cosmic string formation is unavoidable. The strings which form at the end of inflation have a mass which is proportional to the inflationary scale. Sometimes a second network of strings form at a lower scale.

The spontaneous breaking of the first intermediate symmetry, B -L , leads to the generation of cosmic strings and right-handed neutrino masses and further to an observable cosmological background of gravitational waves and generation of light neutrino masses via type-I seesaw mechanism. Supersymmetry breaking manifests as sparticle masses below the B -L breaking but far above the electroweak scale due to proton decay limits. This naturally pushes the B -L breaking scale close to the grand unified theory scale, leading to the formation of metastable cosmic strings, which can provide a gravitational wave spectrum consistent with the recent pulsar timing arrays observation. We perform a detailed analysis of this model using two-loop renormalization group equations, including threshold corrections, to determine the symmetry-breaking scale consistent with the recent pulsar timing arrays signals such as NANOGrav 15-year data and testable by the next-generation limits on proton decay from Hyper-K and JUNO. Simultaneously, we find the regions of the model parameter space that can predict the measured quark and lepton masses and mixing, baryon asymmetry of our Universe, a viable dark matter candidate and can be tested by a combination of neutrinoless double beta decay searches and limits on the sum of neutrinos masses.",

        "abstract": "The creation and evolution of energy-density perturbations are analyzed for the \"new inflationary universe\" scenario proposed by Linde, and Albrecht and Steinhardt. According to the scenario, the Universe underwent a strongly first-order phase transition and entered a \"de Sitter phase\" of exponential expansion during which all previously existing energy-density perturbations expanded to distance scales very large compared to the size of our observable Universe. The existence of an event horizon during the de Sitter phase gives rise to zero-point fluctuations in the scalar field φ, whose slowly growing expectation value signals the transition to the spontaneous-symmetry-breaking (SSB) phase of a grand unified theory (GUT). The fluctuations in φ are created on small distance scales and expanded to large scales, eventually giving rise to an almost scale-free spectrum of adiabatic density perturbations (the so-called Zel'dovich spectrum). When a fluctuation reenters the horizon (radius~=H<SUP>-1</SUP>) during the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) phase that follows the exponential expansion, it has a perturbation amplitude δρρ|<SUB>H</SUB>=(4 or 25)HΔφφ˙(t<SUB>1</SUB>), where H is the Hubble constant during the de Sitter phase (H<SUP>-1</SUP> is the radius of the event horizon), φ˙(t<SUB>1</SUB>) is the mean value of φ˙ at the time (t<SUB>1</SUB>) that the wavelength of the perturbation expanded beyond the Hubble radius during the de Sitter epoch, Δφ is the fluctuation in φ at time t<SUB>1</SUB> on the same scale, and 4 (25) applies if the Universe is radiation (matter) dominated when the scale in question reenters the horizon. Scales larger than about 10<SUP>15</SUP>-10<SUP>16</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB> reenter the horizon when the Universe is matter dominated. Owing to the Sachs-Wolfe effect, these density perturbations give rise to temperature fluctuations in the microwave background which, on all angular scales &gt;&gt;1°, are δTT~=(15)HΔφφ˙(t<SUB>1</SUB>). The value of Δφ expected from de Sitter fluctuations is O(H2π).

While this finding applies to any cosmological scenario involving strings, we consider in particular models of supersymmetric hybrid inflation, which predict n_{\\mathrm {s}} \\gtrsim <P />0.98 , in tension with the CMB data when strings are not included. Using MCMC analysis we constrain the parameter space allowed for F- and D-term inflation. For the F-term model, using minimal supergravity corrections, we find that logκ = -2.34 ± 0.38 and M = (0.518 ± 0.059) × 10<SUP>16</SUP> GeV. The inclusion of non-minimal supergravity corrections can modify these values somewhat. In the corresponding analysis for D-term inflation, we find logκ = -4.24 ± 0.19 and m<SUB>FI</SUB> = (0.245 ± 0.031) × 10<SUP>16</SUP> GeV. Under the assumption that these models are correct, these results represent precision measurements of important parameters of a grand unified theory. We consider the possible uncertainties in our measurements and additional constraints on the scenario from the stochastic background of gravitational waves produced by the strings. The best fitting model predicts a B-mode polarization signal ap0.3 μK rms peaking at \\ell \\approx 1000 . This is of comparable amplitude to the expected signal due to gravitational lensing of the adiabatic E-mode signal on these scales.",

        "abstract": "Models of natural supersymmetry seek to solve the little hierarchy problem by positing a spectrum of light Higgsinos ≲200-300GeV and light top squarks ≲600GeV along with very heavy squarks and TeV-scale gluinos. Such models have low electroweak fine-tuning and satisfy the LHC constraints. However, in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, they predict too low a value of m<SUB>h</SUB>, are frequently in conflict with the measured b→sγ branching fraction, and the relic density of thermally produced Higgsino-like weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) falls well below dark matter measurements. We propose a framework dubbed radiative natural supersymmetry (RNS), which can be realized within the minimal supersymmetric standard model (avoiding the addition of extra exotic matter) and which maintains features such as gauge coupling unification and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. The RNS model can be generated from supersymmetry (SUSY) grand unified theory type models with nonuniversal Higgs masses. Allowing for high-scale soft SUSY breaking Higgs mass m<SUB>H<SUB>u</SUB></SUB>&gt;m<SUB>0</SUB> leads to automatic cancellations during renormalization group running and to radiatively-induced low fine-tuning at the electroweak scale. Coupled with large mixing in the top-squark sector, RNS allows for fine-tuning at the 3%-10% level with TeV-scale top squarks and a 125 GeV light Higgs scalar h. The model allows for at least a partial solution to the SUSY flavor, CP, and gravitino problems since first-/second-generation scalars (and the gravitino) may exist in the 10-30 TeV regime. We outline some possible signatures for RNS at the LHC, such as the appearance of low invariant mass opposite-sign isolated dileptons from gluino cascade decays. The smoking gun signature for RNS is the appearance of light Higgsinos at a linear e<SUP>+</SUP>e<SUP>-</SUP> collider. If the strong CP problem is solved by the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, then RNS naturally accommodates mixed axion-Higgsino cold dark matter, where the light Higgsino-like WIMPs—which in this case make up only a fraction of the measured relic abundance—should be detectable at upcoming WIMP detectors.",

Metastable cosmic strings are not topologically stable, but decay on cosmic time scales due to pair production of GUT monopoles. This leads to a network consisting of metastable long strings on superhorizon scales as well as of string loops and segments on subhorizon scales. We compute for the first time the complete stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) arising from all these network constituents, including several technical improvements to both the derivation of the loop and segment contributions. We find that the gravitational waves emitted by string loops provide the main contribution to the gravitational-wave spectrum in the relevant parameter space. The resulting spectrum is consistent with the tentative signal observed by the NANOGrav and Parkes pulsar timing collaborations for a string tension of G <SUB>μ</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>-11…-7</SUP> and has ample discovery space for ground- and space-based detectors. For GUT-scale string tensions, G <SUB>μ</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>-8…-7</SUP>, metastable strings predict a SGWB in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA band that could be discovered in the near future.",

The only assumptions behind this result are (i) softly broken supersymmetry at low energies with zero cosmological constant, (ii) these particles interact with gravitational strength and the scalar components have a flat potential in perturbation theory, which are well-known properties of string theories. (iii) They acquire a VEV of the order of the Planck scale (as required for the correct value of the gauge coupling constants and the expected compactification scale) after supersymmetry gets broken. We explore the cosmological implications of these particles. Similar to the gravitino, the fermionic states may overclose the Universe if they are stable or destroy nucleosynthesis if they decay unless their masses belong to a certain range or inflation dilutes them. For the scalar states it is known that the problem cannot be entirely solved by inflation, since oscillations around the minimum of the potential, rather than thermal production, are the main source for their energy and can lead to a huge entropy generation at late times. We discuss some possible ways to alleviate this entropy problem, that favour low-temperature baryogenesis, and also comment on the possible role of these particles as dark matter candidates or as sources of the baryon asymmetry through their decay.",

In order to avoid the monopole problem in the breaking of both SO(10) and SU(5), a non-minimal Higgs inflation scenario is incorporated. The radiative breaking of the U(1)<SUB>χ</SUB> symmetry at a slightly lower scale plays a pivotal role in aligning the string tension parameter with the observable range.

We evolve the soft-supersymmetry-breaking parameters according to the renormalization group equations (RGE). The minimization of the Higgs potential is conveniently described by means of tadpole diagrams. We present complete one-loop expressions for these minimization conditions, including contributions from the matter and the gauge sectors. We concentrate on the low tanβ fixed point region (that provides a natural explanation of a large top quark mass) for which we find solutions to the RGE satisfying both experimental bounds and fine-tuning criteria. We also find that the constraint from the consideration of the lightest supersymmetric particle as the dark matter of the Univerese is accommodated in much of parameter space where the lightest neutralino is predominantly gaugino. The supersymmetric mass spectrum displays correlations that are model independent over much of the GUT parameter space.",

We present a revision of the analysis of sphaleron baryon-number violating processes in the standard model including lepton-mass effects. We find the surprising result that a GUT-scale matter asymmetry can survive the B and L violating sphaleron interactions even though ( B - L) is conserved and equals zero for all temperatures. We extend the analysis to cover the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) and also derive the constraints on the R-parity violating couplings in extensions of the MSSM. In the case of the baryon number violating dimension 4 operators we find, contrary to current wisdom, that the resulting bounds can be avoided completely because of a residual lepton-flavour number conservation; in the case of lepton number violating operators we find the bounds are flavour dependent and can be avoided completely in definite flavour channels. We also consider how the bounds are modified in the case where there is a Grand Unified extension of the supersymmetric model which introduces new lepton flavour violating couplings.",

This scenario of inflation, which is called F<SUB>D</SUB>-term hybrid model for brevity, can naturally predict lepton number violation at the electroweak scale, by tying the μ-parameter of the MSSM to an SO(3)-symmetric Majorana mass m<SUB>N</SUB>, via the vacuum expectation value of the inflaton field. We show how a negative Hubble-induced mass term in a next-to-minimal extension of supergravity helps to accommodate the present CMB data and considerably weaken the strict constraints on the theoretical parameters, resulting from cosmic string effects on the power spectrum P<SUB>Script R</SUB>. The usual gravitino overabundance constraint may be significantly relaxed in this model, once the enormous entropy release from the late decays of the ultraheavy waterfall gauge particles is properly considered. As the Universe enters a second thermalization phase involving a very low reheat temperature, which might be as low as about 0.3 TeV, thermal electroweak-scale resonant leptogenesis provides a viable mechanism for successful baryogenesis, while thermal right-handed sneutrinos emerge as new possible candidates for solving the cold dark matter problem. In addition, we discuss grand unified theory realizations of F<SUB>D</SUB>-term hybrid inflation devoid of cosmic strings and monopoles, based on the complete breaking of an SU(2)<SUB>X</SUB> subgroup. The F<SUB>D</SUB>-term hybrid model offers rich particle-physics phenomenology, which could be probed at high-energy colliders, as well as in low-energy experiments of lepton flavour or number violation.",

The maximum temperature in the radiation-dominated era, which we will refer to as the reheat temperature, may have been as low as 0.7 MeV. In this paper we show that a low reheat temperature has important implications for many topics in cosmology. We show that weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP's) may be produced even if the reheat temperature is much smaller than the freeze-out temperature of the WIMP, and that the dependence of the present abundance on the mass and the annihilation cross section of the WIMP differs drastically from familiar results. We reexamine predictions of the relic abundance and resulting model constraints of supersymmetric dark matter, axions, massive neutrinos, and other dark matter candidates, nucleosynthesis constraints on decaying particles, and leptogenesis by decay of superheavy particles. We find that the allowed parameter space of supersymmetric models is altered, removing the usual bounds on the mass spectrum; the cosmological bound on massive neutrinos is drastically changed, ruling out Dirac (Majorana) neutrino masses m<SUB>ν</SUB> only in the range 33 keV &lt;~m<SUB>ν</SUB>&lt;~6 (5) MeV, which is significantly smaller from the standard disallowed range 94 eV &lt;~m<SUB>ν</SUB>&lt;~2 GeV (this implies that massive neutrinos may still play the role of either warm or cold dark matter); the cosmological upper bound on the Peccei-Quinn scale may be significantly increased to 10<SUP>16</SUP> GeV from the usually cited limit of about 10<SUP>12</SUP> GeV; and that efficient out-of-equilibrium grand unified theory GUT baryogenesis and/or leptogenesis can take place even if the reheat temperature is much smaller than the mass of the decaying superheavy particle.",
