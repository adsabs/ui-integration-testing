        "abstract": "This study investigates the realization of R-symmetric Higgs inflation within the framework of no-scale-like supergravity, aiming to elucidate the formation of primordial black holes and observable gravitational waves within a class of GUT models. We explore the possibility of an ultra-slow-roll phase in a hybrid inflation framework, where the GUT Higgs field primarily takes on the role of the inflaton. The amplification of the scalar power spectrum gives rise to scalar-induced gravitational waves and the generation of primordial black holes. The predicted stochastic gravitational wave background falls within the sensitivity range of existing and upcoming gravitational wave detectors, while primordial black holes hold the potential to explain the abundance of dark matter. Furthermore, we highlight the significance of the leading-order nonrenormalizable term in the superpotential of achieving inflationary observables consistent with the latest experimental data. Additionally, the predicted range of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, a key measure of primordial gravitational waves, lies within the observational window of future experiments searching for B-mode polarization patterns in cosmic microwave background data.",

        "abstract": "We present a full one-loop calculation of the gravitino thermal production rate, beyond the so-called hard thermal loop approximation, using the corresponding thermal spectral functions in numerical form on both sides of the light cone. This framework requires a full numerical evaluation. We interpret our results within the framework of a general supergravity-based model, remaining agnostic about the specifics of supersymmetry breaking. In this context, assuming that gravitinos constitute the entirety of the dark matter in the Universe imposes strict constraints on the reheating temperature. For example, with a gluino mass at the current LHC limit, a maximum reheating temperature of T <SUB>reh</SUB> ≃ 10<SUP>9</SUP> GeV is compatible with a gravitino mass of m <SUB>3/2</SUB> ≃ 1 TeV. Additionally, with a reheating temperature an order of magnitude lower at T <SUB>reh</SUB> ≃ 10<SUP>8</SUP> GeV, the common gaugino mass M <SUB>1/2</SUB> can range from 2 to 4 TeV within the same gravitino mass range. For much higher values of M <SUB>1/2</SUB>, which are favored by current accelerator and cosmological data in the context of supersymmetric models, such as M <SUB>1/2</SUB> = 10 TeV, and for m <SUB>3/2</SUB> ≃ 1 TeV the reheating temperature compatible with the gravitino dark matter scenario is 10<SUP>7</SUP> GeV. If other dark matter particles are considered, the reheating temperature could be much lower.",

This model features a two-stage symmetry breaking to the Standard Model, with inflation occurring between the two stages, resulting in the dilution of primordial monopoles produced during the symmetry breaking of $SU(2)_R$ to $U(1)_R$. The second symmetry breaking gives rise to a network of metastable cosmic strings, which produces gravitational waves that can be observed by current and future experiments. A crucial aspect of this model is the inclusion of $R$-symmetry breaking terms in the superpotential, which helps explain the origin of the first symmetry breaking scale and ensures experimentally viable inflation with a minimal (canonical) Kähler potential. We show that the model successfully implements consistent inflation, leptogenesis, metastable cosmic strings, and gravitino dark matter, all in agreement with the observational data and constraints on reheating temperature from leptogenesis and gravitino overproduction bounds. We explore the potential embedding of $G_{3221}$ within the gauge symmetry $G_{422} = SU(4)_c \\times SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$, and provide a brief discussion on the proton decay predictions, which can be tested by the upcoming experiments.",

Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties, the energy scales of both inflation and string formation influence the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by these cosmic strings.",

A high scale breaking of an Abelian gauge symmetry ensures the dynamical origin of the seesaw scale while also leading to the formation of cosmic strings responsible for generating stochastic GW background. The requirement of a correct DM relic in this ballpark necessitates the inclusion of a diluter as PBH typically leads to DM overproduction. This leads to a second early matter dominated epoch after PBH evaporation due to the long-lived diluter. These two early matter dominated epochs, crucially connected to the DM relic, lead to multiple spectral breaks in the otherwise scale-invariant GW spectrum formed by cosmic strings. We find interesting correlations between DM mass and turning point frequencies of GW spectrum which are within reach of several near future experiments like LISA, BBO, ET, CE, etc.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel mechanism for producing topologically stable monopoles (TSMs) from the quantum mechanical decay of metastable cosmic strings in the early universe. In an SO(10) model this mechanism yields TSMs that carry two units (4π/e) of Dirac magnetic charge as well as some color magnetic charge which is screened. For a dimensionless string tension parameter Gμ ≈ 10<SUP>-9</SUP>-10<SUP>-5</SUP>, the monopoles are superheavy with masses of order 10<SUP>15</SUP>-10<SUP>17</SUP> GeV. Monopoles with masses of order 10<SUP>8</SUP>-10<SUP>14</SUP> GeV arise from metastable strings for Gμ values from ∼ 10<SUP>-22</SUP> to 10<SUP>-10</SUP>. We identify the parameter space for producing these monopoles at an observable level with detectors such as IceCube and KM3NeT. For lower Gμ values the ultra-relativistic monopoles should be detectable at Pierre Auger and ANITA. The stochastic gravitational wave emission arise from metastable strings with Gμ ∼ 10<SUP>-9</SUP>-10-5 and should be accessible at HLVK and future detectors including the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. An E <SUB>6</SUB> extension based on this framework would yield TSMs from the quantum mechanical decay of metastable strings that carry three units (6π/e) of Dirac magnetic charge.",

In order to avoid the monopole problem in the breaking of both SO(10) and SU(5), a non-minimal Higgs inflation scenario is incorporated. The radiative breaking of the U(1)<SUB>χ</SUB> symmetry at a slightly lower scale plays a pivotal role in aligning the string tension parameter with the observable range.

Motivated by this remarkable result, we present a novel class of Pati-Salam models that give rise to a network of metastable cosmic strings, offering a plausible explanation for the observed PTA data. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid inflationary scenario to eliminate magnetic monopoles that arise during the subsequent phase transitions from the Pati-Salam symmetry to the Standard Model gauge group. The resulting scalar spectral index is compatible with Planck data, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio is anticipated to be extremely small. Moreover, we incorporate a nonthermal leptogenesis to generate the required baryon asymmetry in our framework. Finally, the gravitational wave spectra generated by the metastable cosmic strings not only correspond to signals observed in recent PTAs, including NANOGrav, but are also within the exploration capacity of both present and future ground- and space-based experiments.",

In this way, gravitational-wave searches with pulsar-timing arrays as well as existing and future laser interferometers may provide information on particle physics beyond the Standard Model. Here, we take one additional step and link particle physics beyond the Standard Model to quantum gravity. We investigate whether particle physics models that may give rise to cosmic strings can be embedded into an asymptotically safe theory of quantum gravity and matter. We focus on models where cosmic strings arise from U(1)-symmetry breaking in an extended Yukawa-Abelian-Higgs sector that may be part of a dark sector. We find a negative answer for the simplest model that can give rise to cosmic strings and also find constraints on an extended model. We tentatively conclude that cosmic strings are difficult to accommodate in asymptotically safe models. This fits well with the latest 15-year dataset and search for new physics from the NANOGrav Collaboration, which disfavors a stable-cosmic-string interpretation. In that sense, the recent data provide an indirect, albeit at present rather tentative, hint about the quantum theory of gravity.",

These strings are known as metastable cosmic strings and have intriguing implications for particle physics and cosmology. In this article, we discuss the current status of metastable cosmic strings, with a focus on possible GUT embeddings and connections to inflation, neutrinos, and gravitational waves (GWs). The GW signal emitted by a network of metastable cosmic strings in the early universe differs, in particular, from the signal emitted by topologically stable strings by a suppression at low frequencies. Therefore, if the underlying symmetry breaking scale is close to the GUT scale, the resulting GW spectrum can be accessible at current ground-based interferometers as well as at future space-based interferometers, such as LISA, and at the same time account for the signal in the most recent pulsar timing data sets. Metastable cosmic strings thus nourish the hope that future GW observations might shed light on fundamental physics close to the GUT scale.",

Focusing for concreteness on the NANOGrav signal (given that all signals are in good agreement between each other), I inspect whether it supports an inflationary SGWB explanation, finding that such an interpretation calls for an extremely blue tensor spectrum, with spectral index n<SUB>T</SUB> ≃ 1.8 ± 0.3, while Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits require a very low reheating scale, T<SUB>rh</SUB> ≲ 10 GeV . While not impossible, an inflationary origin for the PTA signal is barely tenable: within well-motivated inflationary models it is hard to achieve such a blue tilt, whereas models who do tend to predict sizeable non-Gaussianities, excluded by observations. Intriguingly, ekpyrotic models naturally predict a SGWB with spectral index n<SUB>T</SUB> = 2, although with an amplitude too suppressed to be able to explain the signal detected by PTA experiments. Finally, I provide explicit expressions for a bivariate Gaussian approximation to the joint posterior distribution for the intrinsic-noise amplitude and spectral index of the NANOGrav signal, which can facilitate extending similar analyses to different theoretical signals.",

A PBH-dominated phase leads to tilts in the spectrum via entropy dilution and generates a new GW spectrum from PBH density fluctuations, detectable at ongoing and planned near-future GW detectors. The combined spectrum has a unique shape with a plateau, a sharp tilted peak over the plateau, and a characteristic falloff, which can be distinguished from the one generated in the combination of CS and any other matter domination or new exotic physics.

The Planck's bound on the gravitational interaction strength of these strings, characterized by G<SUB>N</SUB>μ<SUB>s</SUB> are easily satisfied with the U(1)<SUB>χ</SUB> symmetry breaking scale which depends on the initial boundary conditions at the GUT scale.

We utilize a symmetry breaking pattern of SO(10) that yields unification of the Standard Model gauge couplings, with the unification scale also linked to inflation driven by an SO(10) singlet scalar field with a Coleman-Weinberg potential. Proton decay mediated by the superheavy gauge bosons may be observable at the proposed Hyper-Kamiokande experiment. Due to an unbroken Z <SUB>2</SUB> gauge symmetry from SO(10), the model predicts the presence of a stable intermediate mass fermion which, together with the axion, provides the desired relic abundance of dark matter. The model also predicts the presence of intermediate scale topologically stable monopoles and strings that survive inflation. The monopoles may be present in the Universe at an observable level. We estimate the stochastic gravitational wave background emitted by the strings and show that it should be testable in a number of planned and proposed space and land based experiments. Finally, we show how the observed baryon asymmetry in the Universe is realized via non-thermal leptogenesis.",

In this regard, using the Swampland conjecture (using (C<SUB>1</SUB>) as the first component of dS swampland conjecture, which is obtained from the first derivative of the potential upon the potential and (C<SUB>2</SUB>) as the second component which is acquired from the second derivative of the potential upon the potential), we investigate the cosmological implications of the present gravity theory, with a suitable potential, in the framework of inflationary scenario to obtain cosmological quantities such as slow-roll parameter, scalar spectral index (n<SUB>s</SUB>) , tensor-to-scalar ratio (r<SUB>s</SUB>), and then compare them with the cosmological observations. Moreover, we compare the compatibility or incompatibility of the model with observable data, such as Planck, by applying Swampland conjecture to r<SUB>s</SUB> -n<SUB>s</SUB> , C<SUB>1,2</SUB> -n<SUB>s</SUB> and C<SUB>1,2</SUB> -r<SUB>s</SUB> plots.",

The monopoles are produced at a higher scale from an earlier symmetry breaking and experience significant inflation before reentering the horizon. This gives rise to monopole-antimonopole pairs connected by string segments and the string loop formation essentially ceases. As a consequence, the lower frequency portion of the gravitational wave spectrum is suppressed relative to the no-inflation case with stable strings, which evades the stringent PPTA bound on the dimensionless string tension Gμ. We display the modified spectrum, accessible in the ongoing and future experiments, for Gμ values in the range 10<SUP>-10</SUP>-10<SUP>-15</SUP>. We show how this 'quasi-stable' string network is realized in realistic grand unified theories.",
